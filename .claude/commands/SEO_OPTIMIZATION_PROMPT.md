## Phase 1: Deep Project Analysis

### 1.1 Content Inventory (ACTION: Read These Files First)

**Immediately use the following tools to gather project data:**

```
1. Glob "features/**/*.data.ts" → Get all content data files
2. Glob "features/**/*.seo.ts" → Get all SEO metadata files
3. Read "lib/config/site.config.ts" → Get site configuration (if exists)
4. Glob "features/*/index.ts" → Understand page structure
5. Read any navigation config files → Understand site hierarchy
```

**Analyze and catalog:**
- All pages in `features/` directory
- All sections within each feature (`features/*/sections/`)
- Content in all `.data.ts` files (text, headings, descriptions)
- SEO metadata in all `.seo.ts` files (titles, descriptions, keywords)
- Site configuration (business name, contact info, social links)
- Current keywords, messaging, and value propositions
- Brand voice patterns (formal, casual, medical, technical, etc.)

### 1.2 Business Understanding (AUTO-DETECT)
**YOU MUST analyze the project content to automatically identify:**

Read and analyze these files:
- `lib/config/site.config.ts` - Site name, description, contact info
- All `features/*/sections/*/*.data.ts` - Service descriptions, value props
- All `features/*/*.seo.ts` - Current keywords and page purposes
- Navigation structure - Service categories and page hierarchy

From this analysis, determine:
- **Primary business type and industry** (e.g., healthcare, legal, e-commerce)
- **Core services/products offered** (extract from service pages/sections)
- **Target audience and demographics** (infer from messaging and services)
- **Geographic service areas** (look for city/region names in content)
- **Unique value propositions** (what makes this business different)
- **Brand voice and tone** (professional, casual, medical, technical, etc.)

**DO NOT ask the user for this information** - extract it from the codebase.

### 1.3 Current SEO Assessment
Evaluate existing:
- Page titles and meta descriptions
- Heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Keyword usage and density
- Content structure and readability
- Internal linking opportunities
- Local SEO signals (city names, areas served, NAP consistency)

---

## Phase 2: Competitor Research

### 2.1 Identify Competitors (AUTO-DETECT LOCATION)
**Automatically determine the geographic area from:**
- Site config files (look for city, region, address)
- Existing content (city names mentioned in data files)
- Contact information (address, phone area codes)
- Default to **Calgary and surrounding areas** if location unclear

**Then research and identify top 5-10 competitors in:**
- The detected geographic area (e.g., "Calgary, AB")
- The identified industry/service category
- Similar business models and target audiences

Use web search to find competitors like:
- "[detected service type] in [detected city]"
- "best [service type] [city]"
- "[service category] [city] reviews"

### 2.2 Competitive SEO Analysis
For each competitor, analyze:
- **Keywords**: What terms are they targeting?
- **Content Strategy**: Topics covered, content depth, structure
- **Local SEO**: How they target geographic areas
- **Meta Data**: Title tags, descriptions, schema markup
- **Content Gaps**: What are they missing that this project can capitalize on?
- **Opportunities**: Underserved keywords or topics

### 2.3 Keyword Research
Compile a comprehensive keyword list including:
- **Primary Keywords**: High-volume, high-intent terms
- **Long-tail Keywords**: Specific, lower-competition phrases
- **Local Keywords**: "[service] in [city]", "[city] [service]"
- **Intent-based Keywords**: Problem-solving queries
- **Semantic Keywords**: Related terms and synonyms

---

## Phase 3: Content Optimization Strategy

### 3.1 Constraints (MUST FOLLOW)
- ✅ **ONLY edit existing files** - NO new pages or sections
- ✅ **Maintain SSG architecture** - All data in `.ts` files
- ✅ **Preserve core messaging** - Keep brand voice and purpose
- ✅ **Respect file structure** - Follow project's organization pattern
- ✅ **File size limits** - Data files max 500 lines
- ✅ **No structural changes** - Don't modify components, only data

### 3.2 Optimization Targets
Focus edits on:
- `features/*/sections/*/*.data.ts` - Content updates
- `features/*/*.seo.ts` - Meta titles, descriptions, keywords
- `lib/config/site.config.ts` - Site-wide SEO settings (if applicable)

### 3.3 Optimization Techniques
Apply these strategies:

#### Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Add location for local SEO
- Keep titles 50-60 characters
- Keep descriptions 150-160 characters
- Make them compelling (CTR optimization)

#### Content Optimization
- Integrate keywords naturally (avoid stuffing)
- Improve heading structure (H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy)
- Add location-specific terms where relevant
- Enhance readability (shorter sentences, bullet points)
- Add semantic keywords and related terms
- Include problem-solving language (address user intent)

#### Local SEO
- Mention city/region names naturally in content
- Include surrounding areas served
- Add neighborhood-specific references where appropriate
- Use local landmarks or context

## Phase 4: Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Present Analysis Summary
Before making changes, provide:
1. **Business Summary**: What you understood about the business
2. **Current SEO State**: Strengths and weaknesses
3. **Competitor Insights**: Key findings from research
4. **Keyword Strategy**: Top keywords to target per page
5. **Optimization Plan**: Which files you'll edit and why

### Step 2: Get User Confirmation (Quick Validation)
Present your findings concisely and ask for quick confirmation:

**Detected:**
- Business: [auto-detected business type]
- Services: [list 3-5 main services]
- Location: [detected city/region]
- Target Audience: [inferred audience]

**Is this correct? Reply 'yes' to proceed or provide corrections.**

Only wait for confirmation if there's significant ambiguity. Otherwise, proceed with optimization.

### Step 3: Execute Optimizations
For each file you edit:
1. Read the current content
2. Apply SEO improvements
3. Maintain original tone and purpose
4. Document changes made

### Step 4: Provide Summary Report
After completion, deliver:
- **Files Modified**: List of all edited files
- **Key Changes**: Summary of major optimizations
- **Keyword Targeting**: Which keywords now target which pages
- **Next Steps**: Additional SEO recommendations (if any)

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All edits maintain brand voice and messaging
- [ ] Keywords are naturally integrated (not forced)
- [ ] No grammatical or spelling errors introduced
- [ ] File size limits respected
- [ ] No new files created unless explicitly requested
- [ ] All `.data.ts` exports remain valid TypeScript

## Example Optimization

### Before (Generic, No SEO):
```typescript
// features/home/sections/hero/hero.data.ts
export const heroData = {
  title: "Welcome to Our Practice",
  subtitle: "We provide quality care",
  description: "Our team is here to help you feel better."
}
```

### After (Calgary-Optimized with Local SEO + Keywords):
```typescript
// features/home/sections/hero/hero.data.ts
export const heroData = {
  title: "Calgary's Trusted Naturopathic Clinic | Holistic Healthcare",
  subtitle: "Comprehensive natural medicine and wellness services in Calgary, AB",
  description: "Experienced naturopathic doctors serving Calgary, Airdrie, Cochrane, and surrounding areas. Offering personalized holistic health solutions, functional medicine, and integrative wellness care."
}
```

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Added "Calgary" for local SEO
- ✅ Included industry keywords: "Naturopathic Clinic", "Holistic Healthcare"
- ✅ Added nearby cities: "Airdrie, Cochrane"
- ✅ Integrated service keywords: "functional medicine", "integrative wellness"
- ✅ Maintained professional, trustworthy tone

## Key Principles

1. **Natural over Forced**: Keywords should flow naturally
2. **Value First**: Content must provide value, not just rank
3. **Local Focus**: Emphasize geographic relevance
4. **User Intent**: Address what users are searching for
5. **Authenticity**: Maintain genuine brand voice
