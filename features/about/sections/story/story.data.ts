        'Founder Linh left a fast-paced downtown salon to open her own studio alongside her daughter Vy. They wanted guests to feel known - remembered by name, by polish shade, and by the stories they shared.

      body:
        "Many salons rush clients through identical services. We listen first, tailor every manicure or pedicure to lifestyle and nail health, and never compromise on sealed, autoclaved tools. Expect thoughtful touches like heated massage chairs, custom art consultations, and technicians who celebrate your milestones with you.",
